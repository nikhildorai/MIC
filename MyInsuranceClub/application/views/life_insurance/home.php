    <h5>What is Travel Insurance?</h5>
    <div>How often do you travel? Do you travel across the globe? Are you a globetrotter? Do you keep one bag eternally packed with your basic necessities because you might have to travel at any time? Your business trips only come at the last minute without much warning?
      <p>Well, in this case have you ever had a problem like:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:none; padding-left:0px;" class="small_i">
        <li><i class="fa fa-slack fa-2"></i> Your baggage was misplaced?</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-slack fa-2"></i> Your passport was stolen?</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-slack fa-2"></i> You missed your connecting flight because the previous one was delayed?</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-slack fa-2"></i> You had to be admitted into a hospital while holidaying in Dubai?</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-slack fa-2"></i> Someone from your office met with a fatal accident during your business trip to London?</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-slack fa-2"></i> Your trip had to be cancelled due to bad weather and you suffered a loss at the flight and hotel reservation?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Travel Insurance has the solution to the all above problems. Travel Insurance means insuring the risks of having a financial loss or a medical emergency while travelling. In case of a medical emergency, your travel insurance will pay for the medical expenses incurred while undergoing treatment abroad. You do not have to worry about the exorbitant medical bills which will taken care of by the insurance company. There are other benefits of cash allowance for delayed flights and loss of baggage, theft of your belongings etc. It pretty much covers all the standard risks involved while travellign abroad.</p>
